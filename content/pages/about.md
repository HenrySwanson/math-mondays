Title: About

I'm Henry, and this is my website! I was a math and CS major at Caltech from 2013-2017, and now I'm
a software engineer in the Bay Area.

I'd like to eventually make this a professional website, but for now, the only section on it is the
math blog.

The blog is two parts "excuse to write about math", two parts "excuse to revisit the math I once
knew", and one part "practice web development".
My particular interests lie in number theory, and algebra more generally. Someday I'll start making
series too, instead of individual articles.
