# About Me

I'm Henry, and this is my website! I'm a software engineer in the Bay Area, and in a previous life (undergrad) I did a lot of math.

I enjoy doing math and turning tasks ("set up a blog") into sprawling, unnecessary, but fun projects ("learn about static site generators and try to roll your own content pipeline") that ultimately become more about the project than the original goal.

# About This Site

I'd like to eventually make this a more comprehensive personal site, but for now, the only section on it is the math blog.

The blog is two parts "excuse to write about math", two parts "excuse to revisit the math I once knew", and one part "practice web development". My particular interests lie in number theory, and algebra more generally. Someday I'll start making series too, instead of individual articles.

This site is created using:

- [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) to generate the contents
    - A handful of plugins to get the behavior I want
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render the math
- [My own sketchy JS code](https://github.com/HenrySwanson/HenrySwanson.github.io) to generate the images and animations
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for privacy-friendly analytics
    - No cookies whatsoever, just for allowing me to watch number go up
- Hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and managed by [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
