<p>The Ax-Grothendieck theorem is the statement:</p>
<div class="theorem-box">
<div class="theorem-title">Ax-Grothendieck Theorem</div>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(f: \CC^n \to \CC^n\)</span> be a polynomial map; that is, each coordinate <span class="math">\(f_i: \CC^n \to \CC\)</span> is a polynomial in the <span class="math">\(n\)</span> input variables.
Then, if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is injective, it is surjective.</p>
</div>
<p>This&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t seem like a particularly exciting theorem. But it has a really exciting proof.</p>


<hr>
<p>The idea behind the proof isn&rsquo;t algebraic, it isn&rsquo;t topological, it&rsquo;s not even geometric, it&rsquo;s <s>DiGiorno</s> model-theoretic!</p>
<p>The spirit of the proof is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the theorem is false, then there is a disproof (a proof of the negation)</li>
<li>this proof can be written in &ldquo;first-order logic&rdquo;, a particularly limited set of axioms</li>
<li>because this proof is finitely long, and uses only first-order logic, it &ldquo;can&rsquo;t tell the difference&rdquo; between <span class="math">\(\CC\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span> for large enough <span class="math">\(p\)</span><ul>
<li>note: <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span> is the algebraic closure of the finite field <span class="math">\(\FF_p\)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pick a large enough <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and transfer our proof to <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span>; this won&rsquo;t affect its structure or validity</li>
<li>show that there is, in fact, no counterexample in <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span></li>
<li>by contradiction, there is no disproof, and the theorem must be true</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an&hellip; unusual proof strategy. I don&rsquo;t usually think about my proofs as mathematical objects unto themselves. But that&rsquo;s probably because I&rsquo;m not a model theorist.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll get the last step out of the way.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em>: Let <span class="math">\(f: \FFx{p}^n \to \FFx{p}^n\)</span> be injective. Pick an arbitrary target <span class="math">\(y_i \in \FFx{p}^n\)</span> to hit. Let <span class="math">\(K \supseteq \FF_p\)</span> be the field extension generated by the <span class="math">\(y_i\)</span> and the coefficients that show up in <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. Since all of these generators are algebraic over <span class="math">\(\FF_p\)</span>, and there&rsquo;s finitely many of them, <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is finite. Also, since fields are closed under polynomial operations, <span class="math">\(f(K^n) \subseteq K^n\)</span>. But because <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is injective, and <span class="math">\(K^n\)</span> is finite, <span class="math">\(f(K^n)\)</span> must be all of <span class="math">\(K^n\)</span>, i.e., there&rsquo;s some input <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(f(x_i) = y_i\)</span>. Thus <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now for the exciting stuff.</p>
<p>We have to figure out a way of taking proofs over <span class="math">\(\CC\)</span>, and translating them into proofs over <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span>. This is daunting, but it&rsquo;s made easier by the fact that they are both algebraically closed fields, and so they have a shared pool of axioms. Of course, they are very different in other ways: <span class="math">\(\CC\)</span> is uncountable while <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span> is countable, they have different characteristic, etc. We have to show that our proof manipulations aren&rsquo;t affected by these differences.</p>
<p>Since this isn&rsquo;t an intro to model theory post, I won&rsquo;t be defining the basic terms. If these look unfamiliar, check out <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6BrJFkqEhh22rFsZ/very-basic-model-theory">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\ACF\)</span> be the theory of algebraically closed fields. We claim that it&rsquo;s first-order, and it&rsquo;s <em>almost</em> complete.</p>
<p>This is a theory in the language of rings, which is <span class="math">\(\cL_{ring} = \{ +, \times, 0, 1 \}\)</span>. Our axioms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the usual field axioms (these are all first-order)</li>
<li>for each <span class="math">\(d \ge 1\)</span>, add the sentence <span class="math">\(\forall a_0 \forall a_1 \cdots \forall a_d \exists x \ a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots a_d x^d = 0 \land a_d \ne 0\)</span><ul>
<li>this are first-order sentences, and together, they tell us that every non-constant polynomial has a root</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\ACF\)</span> is a first-order theory. It isn&rsquo;t complete, of course. For example, the sentence <span class="math">\(1 + 1 = 0\)</span> is true in <span class="math">\(\FFx{2}\)</span>, but not in <span class="math">\(\FFx{3}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\CC\)</span>. Turns out fields of different characteristic are&hellip; different. No surprise there.</p>
<p>So we define extensions of <span class="math">\(\ACF\)</span>, where we <em>do</em> specify the characteristic. For a prime <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, define <span class="math">\(S_p\)</span> to be the sentence <span class="math">\(1 + \cdots + 1 = 0\)</span>, where there are <span class="math">\(p\)</span> copies of <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Then the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\ACF_p = \ACF \cup \{ S_p \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about characteristic <span class="math">\(0\)</span>? To force our field to have characteristic zero, we can throw in <span class="math">\(\lnot S_p\)</span> for all primes <span class="math">\(p\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\ACF_0 = \ACF \cup \{ \lnot S_2, \lnot S_3, \lnot S_5, \ldots \}\)</span>. This nails down exactly the algebraically closed fields of characteristic <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We claim that <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> are complete theories.</p>
<hr>
<p>If that is indeed the case, then we can prove a stronger form of the Ax-Grothendieck theorem.</p>
<div class="theorem-box">
<div class="theorem-title">Ax-Grothendieck Theorem (Stronger)</div>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(k\)</span> be an algebraically closed field. If <span class="math">\(f: k^n \to k^n\)</span> is a polynomial map, then if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is injective, it is surjective.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Proof</em>: We start by breaking our claim into a number of first-order sentences. We can&rsquo;t first-order define an arbitrary polynomial, so we&rsquo;ll work with all polynomials of bounded degree. For a fixed <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, the sentence &ldquo;for all polynomial maps <span class="math">\(f\)</span> of degree at most <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, injectivity of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> implies surjectivity of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>&rdquo; can be expressed as a first-order sentence.</p>
<p>First, introduce <span class="math">\(n \cdot (d+1)\)</span> variables for the coefficients of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. The sentence &ldquo;<span class="math">\(f\)</span> is injective&rdquo; can be made first-order by taking <span class="math">\(f(x) = f(y) \implies x = y\)</span> and expanding out the coefficients of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. Likewise, &ldquo;<span class="math">\(f\)</span> is surjective&rdquo; can be written as <span class="math">\(\forall z \exists x \ f(x) = z\)</span>, and expanding <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an example, if <span class="math">\(n = 1, d = 2\)</span>, our sentence is:
</p>
<div class="math">$$ \forall a_0 \forall a_1 \forall a_2 \ (\forall x \forall y \ a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = a_2 y^2 + a_1 y + a_0 \implies x = y) $$</div>
<div class="math">$$ \implies \forall z \exists x \ a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = z $$</div>
<p>Since I literally never want to write out that sentence in the general case, let&rsquo;s just call it <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span>.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll separately tackle the case of characteristic <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and characteristic <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(p\)</span> be any prime. Because <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> is complete, either there is a proof of <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span> or a proof of <span class="math">\(\lnot \phi_d\)</span>. The latter is impossible; if there were such a proof, then it would show that <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span> is false in <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span>, and we&rsquo;ve proven before that it is true in this field. Therefore, <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> entails a proof of <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, because <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span> is complete, either it can prove <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span>, or it can prove <span class="math">\(\lnot \phi_d\)</span>. Again, for the sake of contradiction, we assume the latter. Let <span class="math">\(P\)</span> be a proof of <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is finite, it can only use finitely many axioms. In particular, it can only use finitely many of the <span class="math">\(\lnot S_p\)</span>. So there&rsquo;s some prime <span class="math">\(q\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\lnot S_q\)</span> was not used in <span class="math">\(P\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is also a valid proof in <span class="math">\(\ACF_q\)</span>. But we already know there are no proofs of <span class="math">\(\lnot \phi_d\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\ACF_q\)</span>, and so we&rsquo;ve reached a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a proof of <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> can prove <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span> can prove <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span>, we know that <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span> is true in all algebraically closed fields <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, no matter what the characteristic of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is. And since <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span> is true for all <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, we have proved the claim for polynomials of arbitrary degree.</p>
<hr>
<p>This proof is magical in two ways.</p>
<p>One is that, despite there being no homomorphisms between <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\CC\)</span>, we were able to somehow transport a claim between the two. This was possible not by looking at the structure of <span class="math">\(\CC\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\FFx{p}\)</span> themselves, but by using the structure of their axiomatizations. The reduction to only finitely many axioms is an example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem">compactness theorem</a>, a very useful logical principle.</p>
<p>The other is that we never actually made use of <span class="math">\(\phi_d\)</span>! All we knew is that it was a first-order sentence, and that it was true in some model of <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> for each <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Generalizing this argument, we get the following principle:</p>
<div class="theorem-box">
<div class="theorem-title">Robinson's Principle</div>
<p>If <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is a first-order sentence, then the following are equivalent:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> proves <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> for all but finitely many <span class="math">\(p\)</span></li></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> proves <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="math">\(p\)</span></li></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span> proves <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span></li></li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, the following are equivalent for <span class="math">\(r\)</span> a prime or <span class="math">\(0\)</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="math">\(\ACF_r\)</span> proves <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span></li></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is true in some algebraically closed field of characteristic <span class="math">\(r\)</span></li></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is true in all algebraically closed fields of characteristic <span class="math">\(r\)</span></li></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>For the first claim, obviously (1) implies (2). The proof that (2) implies (3) is essentially the proof we gave above: if <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> can&rsquo;t be proved from <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\lnot \phi\)</span> can. This proof can only use finitely many of the <span class="math">\(\lnot S_p\)</span>, and there&rsquo;s infinitely many <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> that prove <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>, so there&rsquo;s some <span class="math">\(p\)</span> we can transfer the proof to and get our contradiction. The proof that (3) implies (1) is similar: if there&rsquo;s a proof of <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span>, it can be transferred to all but finitely many <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span>.</p>
<p>The second claim is a direct consequence of completeness of <span class="math">\(\ACF_r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Combining these two claims gives some very powerful techniques. The way we used it is: to show something is true for all algebraically closed fields, it suffices to show it only for a single example at each prime <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>At this point, there is no more spooky magic, and the rest of the article is about justifying the completeness of <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span>. Still cool though, IMO.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll state a popular theorem in model theory:</p>
<div class="theorem-box">
<div class="theorem-title">Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem</div>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> be a countable theory. If it has an infinite model, then for any infinite cardinal <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>, it has a model of size <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Essentially, first-order logic is too limited to distinguish between different sizes of infinity; if there&rsquo;s a model of one infinite size, there&rsquo;s a model of all infinite sizes. The proof of this theorem is somewhat involved, and we won&rsquo;t cover it here, but see <a href="http://modeltheory.wikia.com/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim-Skolem_Theorem">here</a> for a proof.</p>
<p>Using this, we can prove the Łoś–Vaught test:</p>
<div class="theorem-box">
<div class="theorem-title">Łoś–Vaught Test</div>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> be a theory and <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span> be some infinite cardinal. We say that <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>-categorical if there is exactly one model of <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> of size <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>, up to isomorphism.
<br><br>
If <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>-categorical for some <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>, and has no finite models, then it is a complete theory.</p>
</div>
<p>This is unexpected, at least in my opinion. But then again, model theory isn&rsquo;t my forte. Maybe there&rsquo;s some intution one can use here that I don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em>: If <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> isn&rsquo;t complete, then there&rsquo;s some <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> proves neither <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> nor <span class="math">\(\lnot \phi\)</span>. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_completeness_theorem">completeness theorem</a>, this means there&rsquo;s a model <span class="math">\(M\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> in which <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is true, and a model <span class="math">\(M'\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> in which <span class="math">\(\lnot \phi\)</span> is true.</p>
<p>Since all models of <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> are infinite, both <span class="math">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M'\)</span> are infinite. This means that <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is an infinite model of <span class="math">\(\cT \cup \{ \phi \}\)</span>, thus we can apply Löwenheim–Skolem to get a model <span class="math">\(N\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\cT \cup \{ \phi \}\)</span> which has size <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>. Likewise, we use <span class="math">\(M'\)</span> to get a model <span class="math">\(N'\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\cT \cup \{ \lnot \phi \}\)</span> which has size <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>. But because <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>-categorical and both <span class="math">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N'\)</span> are models of <span class="math">\(\cT\)</span>, they must be isomorphic. But because <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is true in <span class="math">\(N\)</span> and false in <span class="math">\(N'\)</span>, this is a contradiction.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to apply the Łoś–Vaught test to <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span>. Since all algebraically closed fields are infinite, it suffices to show that these theories are <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>-categoral for some <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em>: Let <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span> be an uncountable cardinal and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> be an algebraically closed field of size <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(B\)</span> be a transcendence basis of <span class="math">\(K\)</span> over its prime subfield <span class="math">\(k\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\FF_p\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\QQ\)</span>). <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Field_of_Uncountable_Cardinality_K_has_Transcendence_Degree_K">A cardinality argument</a> shows that <span class="math">\(\|B\| = \kappa\)</span> (this is where the uncountability of <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span> is used; for example, <span class="math">\(\overline{\QQ}(t_1, \ldots, t_n)\)</span> has transcendence degree <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, but cardinality <span class="math">\(\aleph_0\)</span>). So, if <span class="math">\(K'\)</span> is another algebraically closed field, with the same cardinality and characteristic, and we pick a transcendence basis <span class="math">\(B'\)</span>, it will also have cardinality <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>. The bijection between <span class="math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B'\)</span> induces an isomorphism between <span class="math">\(k(B)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k(B')\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K'\)</span> are algebraically closed, and algebraic over <span class="math">\(k(B) \cong k(B')\)</span>, they are algebraic closures of the same field, and are thus isomorphic!</p>
<p>This proves that <span class="math">\(\ACF_p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\ACF_0\)</span> are <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>-categorical for uncountable cardinals <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>. In particular, they&rsquo;re <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span>-categorical for at least one infinite cardinal, and so via the Łoś–Vaught test, we conclude they are complete.</p>
