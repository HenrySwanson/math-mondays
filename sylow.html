<p>In group theory, the Sylow theorems are a triplet of theorems that pin down a suprising amount of information about certain subgroups.</p>
<p>Lagrange&rsquo;s theorem tells us that if <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, then the size of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> divides the size of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. The Sylow theorems give us some answers to the converse question: for what divisors of <span class="math">\(|G|\)</span> can we find a subgroup of that size?</p>


<hr>
<p>For a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, and a prime <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> be the largest integer such that <span class="math">\(p^n\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(|G|\)</span>. A <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a subgroup of order <span class="math">\(p^k\)</span>, and if it has order <span class="math">\(p^n\)</span>, then it is called a Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup. Under these definitions, the Sylow theorems are:</p>
<div class="theorem-box">
<div class="theorem-title">Sylow Theorems</div>
<ol>
<li>Every <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup is contained in a Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup. As such, Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups exist.</li>
<li>All Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups are conjugate to each other.</li>
<li>Let <span class="math">\(n_p\)</span> be the number of Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups, and <span class="math">\(m = |G|/p^n\)</span>. Then the following hold:<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(n_p\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(m\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(n_p \equiv 1 \bmod p\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(n_p = [G : N(P)]\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(N(P)\)</span> is the normalizer of any Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>These are rather technical and deserve some more thorough digestion. Sylow 1 tells us that maximal <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups are as big as possible; there is no obstruction preventing them from being the full <span class="math">\(p^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Sylow 2 tells us that all Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups are isomorphic in a very strong way; there is a conjugation of the group sending them to each other. To see how this is a strong criterion, consider a non-example. Let <span class="math">\(G = \ZZ_4 \times \ZZ_2\)</span>, and pick out the subgroups <span class="math">\(H_1 = \{ (0, 0), (2, 0) \}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(H_2 = \{ (0, 0), (0, 1) \}\)</span>. It&rsquo;s clear that <span class="math">\(H_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(H_2\)</span> are isomorphic, but they are not conjugate. This manifests in <span class="math">\(G/H_1 = \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(G/H_2 = \ZZ_4\)</span> not being isomorphic.</p>
<p>Sylow 3 is the easiest to understand; it just puts some arithmetic criteria on <span class="math">\(n_p\)</span>. For small-ish groups, this is often enough to nail down <span class="math">\(n_p\)</span> exactly!</p>
<p>On to the proofs!</p>
<h2>Lemma</h2>
<p>First let&rsquo;s establish a lemma we&rsquo;ll use frequently.</p>
<div class="theorem-box">
<div class="theorem-title">Lemma</div>
<p>If <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-group, and it acts on a set <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(|X| \equiv |\Fix(X)| \bmod p\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\Fix(X)\)</span> is the set of points in <span class="math">\(X\)</span> that are fixed by every <span class="math">\(g \in G\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Proof: Let <span class="math">\(x_1, \ldots, x_k\)</span> be representatives for the <span class="math">\(G\)</span>-orbits of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. We know that the sum of the sizes of the orbits is <span class="math">\(|X|\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> is a fixed point, then the orbit is of size <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. If it is not, then by orbit-stabilizer, the size of the orbit is <span class="math">\([G : \Stab(x_i)]\)</span>, which is divisible by <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Thus, mod <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, every fixed point contributes <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and everything else in <span class="math">\(X\)</span> contributes <span class="math">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<h2>Sylow 1</h2>
<p>Given a <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, we show that, if it is not already maximal, we can find a <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup <span class="math">\(H' \supset H\)</span> that is <span class="math">\(p\)</span> times bigger. Repeating this process gives us a Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup containing our original <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. Since the trivial subgroup is a <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup, this also establishes the existence of Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups!</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(H\)</span> be a <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-group that is not maximal, i.e., it has order <span class="math">\(p^i\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(i &lt; n\)</span>. There is a natural action of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> on the left coset space <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span>, and since <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-group, our lemma tells us that <span class="math">\(|G/H|\)</span> is equivalent to the number of fixed points mod <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\(i &lt; n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span> has order divisible by <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. So the number of fixed points of this action is also divisible by <span class="math">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>What do fixed points of this action look like? If <span class="math">\(gH\)</span> is a coset fixed by <span class="math">\(h \in H\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(hgH = gH\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math">\(g^{-1} h g \in H\)</span>. If this is true for all <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(g\)</span> lies in the normalizer of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. The converse is also true, since these implications were all reversible. This means that <span class="math">\(N(H)\)</span> is composed of the cosets of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> that are fixed points.</p>
<p>Combining the two observations above, we conclude that <span class="math">\([N(H) : H]\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Therefore, by Cauchy&rsquo;s theorem, there&rsquo;s some subgroup of order <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in <span class="math">\(N(H)/H\)</span>. Lifting this subgroup to <span class="math">\(N(H)\)</span>, we get a subgroup of size <span class="math">\(p \cdot |H| = p^{i+1}\)</span>. This is the <span class="math">\(H'\)</span> we were looking for.</p>
<h2>Sylow 2</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> be two Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. We want to show they are conjugate.</p>
<p>There is a natural action of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> on <span class="math">\(G\)</span> by multiplication, and this descends to an action of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> on <span class="math">\(G/Q\)</span> (again, left coset space). From our lemma, the number of fixed points of this action is equivalent to <span class="math">\(|G/Q|\)</span>, mod <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is a Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup, <span class="math">\(|G/Q|\)</span> is not divisible by <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. This means that the number of fixed points cannot be zero; i.e., there is at least one fixed point for this action. This is some <span class="math">\(gQ\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(pgQ = gQ\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(p \in P\)</span>. Or, rearranging the terms, a <span class="math">\(g\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(g^{-1}pg \in Q\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(p \in P\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> are the same size, being Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups, this means that <span class="math">\(g^{-1}Pg = Q\)</span>, and so they are indeed conjugate.</p>
<h2>Sylow 3</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(P\)</span> be a particular Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup, and let it act on the set of <em>all</em> Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups by conjugation. We claim that <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is the only fixed point of this action. This would, by our lemma (we&rsquo;re getting so much mileage out of this baby), instantly tell us that <span class="math">\(n_p \equiv 1 \bmod p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider some fixed point <span class="math">\(Q\)</span>. Then for any <span class="math">\(p \in P\)</span>, <span class="math">\(p^{-1}Qp = Q\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(P\)</span> lies in the normalizer of <span class="math">\(Q\)</span>. Since both <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> are Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>, they are both Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups of <span class="math">\(N(Q)\)</span>. By Sylow 2, they must be conjugate, but since <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> is normal in <span class="math">\(N(Q)\)</span>, it&rsquo;s not going anywhere under conjugation. Thus <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> must equal <span class="math">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, we show that <span class="math">\(n_p = [G : N(P)]\)</span>. Consider the action of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> by conjugation on the set of Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups. There&rsquo;s only one orbit, because of Sylow 2, and by orbit-stabilizer, it has size <span class="math">\([G : \Stab(P)]\)</span>. But the stabilizer of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is just the normalizer, so <span class="math">\(n_p = [G : N(P)]\)</span>, as desired.</p>
<p>Lastly, since <span class="math">\(m = [G : P] = [G : N(P)] [N(P) : P]\)</span>, we get that <span class="math">\(n_p\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(m\)</span> for free.</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p>Cool! These are nice theorems, how do we put them to use? Let&rsquo;s look at some example applications.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Show that <span class="math">\(\ZZ_{35}\)</span> is the only group of size <span class="math">\(35\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be a group of size <span class="math">\(35\)</span>. We&rsquo;ll consider its Sylow <span class="math">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math">\(7\)</span>-subgroups. By Sylow 3, we know that <span class="math">\(n_5 \equiv 1 \bmod 5\)</span>, and divides <span class="math">\(7\)</span>. This means it&rsquo;s gotta be <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, which means <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has a normal subgroup of size <span class="math">\(5\)</span>. Likewise, <span class="math">\(n_7 \equiv 1 \bmod 7\)</span>, and divides <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has a normal subgroup of size <span class="math">\(7\)</span> as well. They intersect trivially, since their sizes are relatively prime, so <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a direct product of these groups. Therefore, <span class="math">\(G \cong \ZZ_5 \times \ZZ_7\)</span>, which is <span class="math">\(\ZZ_{35}\)</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Classify all groups of order <span class="math">\(105\)</span>.</em></p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be a group of order <span class="math">\(105\)</span>. First, we show that it has normal Sylow <span class="math">\(5\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(7\)</span>-subgroups. Sylow 3 restricts <span class="math">\(n_5 = 1,21\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n_7 = 1,15\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(n_5 = 1\)</span>, then there&rsquo;s a unique Sylow <span class="math">\(5\)</span>-subgroup <span class="math">\(N_5\)</span>. Picking out some Sylow <span class="math">\(7\)</span>-subgroup <span class="math">\(P_7\)</span>, we get a subgroup <span class="math">\(H = N_5 P_7\)</span> of size <span class="math">\(35\)</span> (the normality of <span class="math">\(N_5\)</span> is necessary for this to be a subgroup). But from our previous exercise, we know that this must be isomorphic to <span class="math">\(\ZZ_{35}\)</span>. Since it&rsquo;s abelian, <span class="math">\(P_7\)</span> must of course be normal in <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. This means that the normalizer <span class="math">\(N(P_7) \supseteq H\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(n_7 = [G : N(P_7)] \le [G : H] = 3\)</span>, we are forced to conclude that <span class="math">\(n_7 = 1\)</span> as well.</p>
<p>Likewise, if <span class="math">\(n_7 = 1\)</span>, we can construct a subgroup <span class="math">\(H = P_5 N_7\)</span> isomorphic to <span class="math">\(\ZZ_{35}\)</span>, in which <span class="math">\(P_5\)</span> is normal. The index of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> here is <span class="math">\(7\)</span>, and this also pins down <span class="math">\(n_5 = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>If neither of these are <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, then we run out of elements. Each of these subgroups intersects trivially (because they have prime order), and so we would have <span class="math">\(20 \cdot 4\)</span> non-identity elements from the Sylow <span class="math">\(5\)</span>-subgroups, and <span class="math">\(15 \cdot 6\)</span> non-identity elements from the Sylow <span class="math">\(7\)</span>-subgroups. Adding in the identity, this is a total of <span class="math">\(171\)</span> elements, way too many.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has normal Sylow <span class="math">\(5\)</span>- and <span class="math">\(7\)</span>-subgroups, and their product is a subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span> or size <span class="math">\(35\)</span>. As the product of normal subgroups, it is itself normal. Cauchy&rsquo;s theorem gives us an element <span class="math">\(x\)</span> of order <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, and it generates a subgroup <span class="math">\(K\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> intersect trivially, <span class="math">\(HK\)</span> is the whole group, and so <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a semidirect product of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K\)</span>.</p>
<p>What options do we have for our twisting homomorphism <span class="math">\(\phi : K \to \Aut(H)\)</span>? All we have to do is specify <span class="math">\(\phi(x)\)</span>, and all we need is that <span class="math">\(\phi(x)^3\)</span> is the identity.</p>
<p>The automorphisms of <span class="math">\(\ZZ_n\)</span> are those given by multiplying by some <span class="math">\(a\)</span> relatively prime to <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. As such, the automorphisms of <span class="math">\(\ZZ_{35}\)</span> with degree dividing <span class="math">\(3\)</span> are <span class="math">\((r \mapsto ar)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(a^3 \equiv 1 \bmod 35\)</span>. The only such solutions are <span class="math">\(1, 11, 16\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a = 1\)</span>, then this is the trivial automorphism, and so <span class="math">\(G \cong \ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_{35} \cong \ZZ_{105}\)</span>.</p>
<p>It turns out that the groups for <span class="math">\(a = 11\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a = 16\)</span> are isomorphic, but I can&rsquo;t figure out a clean way to show it at the moment. Stay tuned. <!--TODO--></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Show <span class="math">\(A_5\)</span> is the smallest non-abelian simple group.</em></p>
<p>To prove this, we need to eliminate the possibility of a simple non-abelian group of any smaller size. First, we can eliminate primes; any group of size <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is cyclic, hence abelian.</p>
<p>We can also eliminate prime powers. Any group of prime power order has a non-trivial center, so it cannot be simple.</p>
<p>Next, we eliminate anything that is <span class="math">\(2\)</span> mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span>. Such a number is equal to <span class="math">\(2m\)</span> with <span class="math">\(m\)</span> odd. If <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a group of size <span class="math">\(2m\)</span>, let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> act on itself by multiplication. This gives us a map <span class="math">\(\phi : G \to S_{2m}\)</span> sending <span class="math">\(g\)</span> to the permutation it induces. By Cauchy&rsquo;s theorem, there&rsquo;s an element of order <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. This induces a product of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> transpositions, and thus an odd permutation. So the map <span class="math">\(\sgn \circ \phi : G \to \{ \pm 1 \}\)</span> is surjective, and so its kernel is a non-trivial proper subgroup of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. (Unless <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has order <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, but we already handled that case.)</p>
<p>Our last big sweep will be to eliminate groups of size <span class="math">\(p^k m\)</span> with <span class="math">\(m &lt; p\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(n_p\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(n_p \le m &lt; p\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(n_p\)</span> is <span class="math">\(1\)</span> mod <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and so must be <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. If there is a single Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroup, it must be normal. This eliminates 15, 20, 21, 28, 33, 35, 39, 44, 51, 52, 55, and 57.</p>
<p>This leaves us with 12, 24, 36, 40, 45, 48, and 56.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(|G|=40\)</span>: From the congruence conditions, we know that <span class="math">\(n_5\)</span> is <span class="math">\(1\)</span> mod <span class="math">\(5\)</span> and divides <span class="math">\(8\)</span>. But this forces it to be <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, so there is a unique Sylow <span class="math">\(5\)</span>-subgroup. </p>
<p><span class="math">\(|G|=45\)</span>: Similar to <span class="math">\(|G|=40\)</span>, the arithmetic restrictions force <span class="math">\(n_5\)</span> to be <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(|G| = 12\)</span>: We know that <span class="math">\(n_3\)</span> is either <span class="math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(4\)</span>. If it&rsquo;s not <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, there&rsquo;s <span class="math">\(4\)</span> Sylow <span class="math">\(3\)</span>-subgroups, and because they have prime order, they intersect trivially. This gives <span class="math">\(8\)</span> elements of order <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, leaving <span class="math">\(4\)</span> other elements to constitute the Sylow <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-subgroups. But each Sylow <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-subgroup has <span class="math">\(4\)</span> elements, and so there is a unique (hence normal) one.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(|G| = 56\)</span>: Similar to the case for <span class="math">\(12\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(n_7\)</span> is not <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, it is <span class="math">\(8\)</span>, yielding <span class="math">\(48\)</span> elements of order <span class="math">\(7\)</span>. The leftover <span class="math">\(8\)</span> elements form the unique Sylow <span class="math">\(2\)</span>-subgroup.</p>
<p>For the other three cases we need some stronger stuff.</p>
<p><em>Claim</em>: if <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is simple and non-abelian, then for all <span class="math">\(p\)</span> dividing <span class="math">\(|G|\)</span>, we must have <span class="math">\(|G|\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(n_p!\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof</em>: Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> act on the Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups by conjugation. Because there are <span class="math">\(n_p\)</span> of them, this gives us a homomorphism <span class="math">\(\phi : G \to S_{n_p}\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is simple, <span class="math">\(\ker \phi\)</span> is either trivial or all of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Because all Sylow <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-subgroups are conjugate, the latter situation only occurs when there is only one of them, something impossible if <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is simple and non-abelian. </p>
<!-- TODO you don't need abelian-ness, having no other conjugates means you're normal! -->

<p>This leaves us with the former case, where the kernel is trivial, and thus <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is an injection. Identifying <span class="math">\(G\)</span> as a subgroup of <span class="math">\(S_{n_p}\)</span>, we get that <span class="math">\(|G|\)</span> divides <span class="math">\(n_p!\)</span> as promised.</p>
<p>We can now eliminate the last cases.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(|G|=24\)</span>: We know that <span class="math">\(n_2\)</span> is either <span class="math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(3\)</span>, by the usual congruence conditions. But now we have a new tool. If <span class="math">\(G\)</span> were simple, then <span class="math">\(24\)</span> would divide <span class="math">\(n_2!\)</span>, which it can&rsquo;t in either case. So <span class="math">\(G\)</span> can&rsquo;t be simple.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(|G|=36\)</span>: We know <span class="math">\(n_3\)</span> is <span class="math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(4\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is simple, then <span class="math">\(36\)</span> would divide <span class="math">\(n_3!\)</span>, which it can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(|G|=48\)</span>: Identical to the case for <span class="math">\(24\)</span>.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>This was a lot of work. Back when I was in high school, we had to prove this without the Sylow theorems, and by god we appreciated them. Get off my lawn!</p>
<p>(But actually though, that was an&hellip; experience.)</p>
