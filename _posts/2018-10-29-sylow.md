In group theory, the Sylow theorems are a triplet of theorems that pin down a suprising amount of information about certain subgroups.

Lagrange's theorem tells us that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then the size of $H$ divides the size of $G$. The Sylow theorems give us some answers to the converse question: for what divisors of $|G|$ can we find a subgroup of that size?

For a group $G$, and a prime $p$, and $n$ be the largest integer such that $p^n$ divides $|G|$. A $p$-subgroup of $G$ is a subgroup of order $p^k$, and if it has order $p^n$, then it is called a Sylow $p$-subgroup. Under these definitions, the Sylow theorems are:
  1. Every $p$-subgroup is contained in a Sylow $p$-subgroup. As such, Sylow $p$-subgroups exist.
  2. All Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate to each other.
  3. Let $n_p$ be the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups, and $m = |G|/p^n$. Then the following hold:
  * $n_p$ divides $m$
  * $n_p \equiv 1 \bmod p$
  * $n_p = [G : N(P)]$, where $N(P)$ is the normalizer of any Sylow $p$-subgroup.

These are rather technical and deserve some more thorough digestion. Sylow 1 tells us that maximal $p$-subgroups are as big as possible; there is no obstruction preventing them from being the full $p^n$.

Sylow 2 tells us that all Sylow $p$-subgroups are isomorphic in a very strong way; there is a conjugation of the group sending them to each other. To see how this is a strong criterion, consider a non-example. Let $G = \ZZ_4 \times \ZZ_2$, and pick out the subgroups $H_1 = \{ (0, 0), (2, 0) \}$ and $H_2 = \{ (0, 0), (0, 1) \}$. It's clear that $H_1$ and $H_2$ are isomorphic, but they are not conjugate. This manifests in $G/H_1 = \ZZ_2 \times \ZZ_2$ and $G/H_2 = \ZZ_4$ not being isomorphic.

Sylow 3 is the easiest to understand; it just puts some arithmetic criteria on $n_p$. For small-ish groups, this is often enough to nail down $n_p$ exactly!

Onto the proofs!

## Lemma

First let's establish a lemma we'll use frequently.

If $G$ is a $p$-group, and it acts on a set $X$, then $\|X\| \equiv \|\Fix(X)\| \bmod p$, where $\Fix(X)$ is the set of points in $X$ that are fixed by every $g \in G$.

Proof: Let $x_1, \ldots, x_k$ be representatives for the $G$-orbits of $X$. We know that the sum of the sizes of the orbits is $\|X\|$. If $x_i$ is a fixed point, then the orbit is of size $1$. If it is not, then by orbit-stabilizer, the size of the orbit is $[G : \Stab(x_i)]$, which is divisible by $p$. Thus, mod $p$, every fixed point contributes $1$, and everything else in $X$ contributes $0$.

## Sylow 1

Given a $p$-subgroup $H$, we show that, if it is not already maximal, we can find a $p$-subgroup $H' \supset H$ that is $p$ times bigger. Repeating this process gives us a Sylow $p$-subgroup containing our original $H$. Since the trivial subgroup is a $p$-subgroup, this also establishes the existence of Sylow $p$-subgroups!

Let $H$ be a $p$-group that is not maximal, i.e., it has order $p^i$, where $i < n$. There is a natural action of $H$ on the left coset space $G/H$, and since $H$ is a $p$-group, our lemma tells us that $\|G/H\|$ is equivalent to the number of fixed points mod $p$. But since $i < n$, $G/H$ has order divisible by $p$. So the number of fixed points of this action is also divisible by $p$.

What do fixed points of this action look like? If $gH$ is a coset fixed by $h \in H$, then $hgH = gH$, i.e., $g^{-1} h g \in H$. If this is true for all $h$, then $g$ lies in the normalizer of $H$. The converse is also true, since these implications were all reversible. This means that $N(H)$ is composed of the cosets of $H$ that are fixed points.

Combining the two observations above, we conclude that $[N(H) : H]$ is divisible by $p$. Therefore, by Cauchy's theorem, there's some subgroup of order $p$ in $N(H)/H$. Lifting this subgroup to $N(H)$, we get a subgroup of size $p \cdot \|H\| = p^{i+1}$. This is the $H'$ we were looking for.

## Sylow 2

Let $P$ and $Q$ be two Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$. We want to show they are conjugate.

There is a natural action of $P$ on $G$ by multiplication, and this descends to an action of $P$ on $G/Q$ (again, left coset space). From our lemma, the number of fixed points of this action is equivalent to $\|G/Q\|$, mod $p$. But since $Q$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup, $\|G/Q\|$ is not divisible by $p$. This means that the number of fixed points cannot be zero; i.e., there is at least one fixed point for this action. This is some $gQ$ such that $pgQ = gQ$ for all $p \in P$. Or, rearranging the terms, a $g$ such that $g^{-1}pg \in Q$ for all $p \in P$. Since $P$ and $Q$ are the same size, being Sylow $p$-subgroups, this means that $g^{-1}Pg = Q$, and so they are indeed conjugate.

## Sylow 3

Let $P$ be a particular Sylow $p$-subgroup, and let it act on the set of _all_ Sylow $p$-subgroups by conjugation. We claim that $P$ is the only fixed point of this action. This would, by our lemma (we're getting so much mileage out of it), instantly tell us that $n_p \equiv 1 \bmod p$.

Consider some fixed point $Q$. Then for any $p \in P$, $p^{-1}Qp = Q$, which means that $P$ lies in the normalizer of $Q$. Since both $P$ and $Q$ are Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$, they are both Sylow $p$-subgroups of $N(Q)$. By Sylow 2, they must be conjugate, but since $Q$ is normal in $N(Q)$, it's not going anywhere under conjugation. Thus $Q$ must equal $P$.

Next, we show that $n_p = [G : N(P)]$. Consider the action of $G$ by conjugation on the set of Sylow $p$-subgroups. There's only one orbit, because of Sylow 2, and by orbit-stabilizer, it has size $[G : \Stab(P)]$. But the stabilizer of $P$ is just the normalizer, so $n_p = [G : N(P)]$, as desired.

Lastly, since $m = [G : P] = [G : N(P)] [N(P) : P]$, we get that $n_p$ divides $m$ for free.

## Applications

Cool! These are nice theorems, how do we put them to use? Let's look at some example applications.

*Show that $\ZZ_{15}$ is the only group of size $15$.*

Let $G$ be a group of size $15$. We'll consider its Sylow $3$ and $5$-subgroups. We know that $n_3 \equiv 1 \bmod p$, and divides $5$. This means it's gotta be $1$, which means $G$ has a normal subgroup of size $3$. Likewise, $n_5 \equiv 1 \bmod 5$, and divides $3$, so $G$ has a normal subgroup of size $5$. They must intersect trivially, since their sizes are relatively prime, so $G$ is a direct product of these groups. But his means $G \cong \ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_5$, which is $\ZZ_{15}$.

*Classify all groups of order $75$.*

Let $G$ be a group of order $75$. By Sylow 3, we find that $n_5 = 1$, so $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ of order $25$. Since $3$ divides $75$, Cauchy's theorem gives us a subgroup of size $3$, and together these break up $G$ into a semidirect product: $G = N \rtimes_\phi \ZZ_3$, for some $\phi : \ZZ_3 \to \Aut(N)$.

There are two possibilities for $N$: $\ZZ_{25}$ and $\ZZ_5 \times \ZZ_5$. The former has automorphism group $\ZZ_{25}^\times$, which has $20$ elements. Since $3$ doesn't divide $20$, this forces $\phi$ to be trivial, giving us the group $\ZZ_3 \times \ZZ_{25}$, i.e., $\ZZ_{75}$.

In the latter case, the automorphism group is $\Aut(\ZZ_5 \times \ZZ_5) = GL_2(\FF_5)$. (Unpack the definitions a bit if this isn't clear.) With some linear algebra tricks, you can show that all elements of order $3$ are conjugate to $\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\ 1 & -1\end{smallmatrix}$, and those will all produce the same semidirect product. So we have two possibilities, $\phi$ is trivial, which gives us $\ZZ_5 \times \ZZ_5 \times \ZZ_3$, or $\phi$ is non-trivial and we get the group $(\ZZ_5 \times \ZZ_5) \rtimes_\phi \ZZ_3$.

*Show $A_5$ is the smallest non-abelian simple group.*

To prove this, we need to eliminate the possibility of a simple group of any smaller size. Of course, we can eliminate primes immediately, since cyclic groups are abelian. Prime powers have non-trivial centers, which means it can't be simple.

Any group of size $p^k m$ where $m < p$ has a single (and thus normal) Sylow $p$-subgroup, since $n_p$ divides $m$, but is $1$ mod $p$. This eliminates 6, 10, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 28, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42, 44, 46, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, and 58.

This leaves us with 12, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 48, and 56.

$|G| = 12$: We know that $n_3$ is either $1$ or $4$. If it is $4$, then there are $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ elements of order $3$ (since these subgroups can't overlap). This leaves us with $4$ elements to constitute our Sylow $2$-groups, which are of order $4$. Therefore, we must have a unique (thus normal) Sylow $2$-subgroup.

$|G| = 56$: We know that $n_7 = 1$ or $8$. If it is $8$, then, similar to above, there are $8 \cdot 6 = 48$ elements or order $7$, leaving us with $8$ elements to make a Sylow $2$-subgroup. But this is only enough to make one such group, so it must be normal.
